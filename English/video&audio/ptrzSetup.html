    <p>PTRZ enables a camera to move up and down, left and right, zoom in and out, and rotate even if it is not a PTZ camera. Particularly when a camera is installed on a ceiling, wall, or corner, PTRZ is useful for adjusting the camera position vertically and horizontally to secure an optimal view. </p>
    <p>In the 'PTRZ setup' page, the PTRZ function can be used to adjust the camera position and set the focus. When the setting is completed, click the <strong class="UI">[Apply]</strong>&nbsp;button at the bottom of the page.</p>
