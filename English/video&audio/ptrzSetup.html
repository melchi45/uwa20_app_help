<h1 class="wn5-setup-main-title">PTRZ setup</h1>
<div class="wn5-setup-section">
    <p>PTRZ is a function that allows a camera without PTZ function to pan, tilt, move, and rotate as well as zooming in/out on the camera. This is especially useful for cameras that are mounted on the ceiling/wall or in the corner since it allows the directional movement of the camera position to offer an optimal view. </p>
    <p>In &apos;PTRZ setup&apos; page, you can use the PTRZ function to adjust the camera position and set up zoom &amp; focus. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is recommended to use the PTRZ function to set the desired field of view or align the video screen horizontally when installing the camera. </li>

            <p>After you select a camera channel, you can specify the details of PTRZ (camera pan &amp; tilt location, rotating, and zooming) for each channel. </p>
            <p>Once you select a channel, only the video of the selected channel will be displayed on the screen, and you can specify the details of each individual PTRZ for each channel. </p>
            <p>If you select the Multi view icon, you can see the videos of every channel all at once, and apply the same values to all cameras. You can also apply the same values to only one or more cameras of your choice.  </p>
            <p>Also, in the Multi view mode, a message that describes the status of each camera is displayed at the bottom of the preview screen of each channel. One of the following messages will be displayed: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initializing: This message is displayed when the camera initialization is in progress after <strong class="UI">[Initialize PTRZ]</strong> is clicked. Until initialization is complete, no other action can be made.</li>
                <li>Initialization failed: This message is displayed due to several reasons such as camera stepping out of phase during the process of camera setup initialization. If initialization is incomplete, PTR control might not work properly. In that case, change the camera position and reinitialize.</li>
                <li>Moving to preset: This message is displayed when camera is currently moving to a preset position you already set up upon clicking <strong class="UI">[360]</strong>, <strong class="UI">[200]</strong>, or <strong class="UI">[User preset]</strong>. Until the movement is complete, no other action can be made.</li>
                <li>Preset failed: This message is displayed when camera fails to move to a preset position due to problems such as out-of-phase issue. Change the camera position by adjusting the PTR of the camera, and retry the Goto preset operation.</li>
                <li>Currently moving: This message is displayed when any one of the PTR (Pan / tilt / rotation) operations is in action.</li>
                <li>Collided: This message is displayed when a camera is unable to move as it comes into contact with another camera that uses a different channel.</li>
                <li>Standby: This message is displayed when PTR is in idle mode and cameras are keeping a certain distance from one another.</li>
