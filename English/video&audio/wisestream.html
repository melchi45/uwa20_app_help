<h1 class="wn5-setup-main-title">WiseStream</h1>

<div class="wn5-setup-section">
    <p>WiseStream is a function that, by analyzing the complexity of an image, can effectively reduce the data size while still maintaining the quality. It reduces image size and saves on bandwidth by increasing the compression rate, if many motions are not created on the image being captured by the camera. If motion increases, the image returns to its previous status, preventing image information loss. This function is not suitable in an environment with much motion, as the screen may malfunction. When you complete the setting, click the <strong class="UI">[Apply]</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</p>

                <li><strong class="UI">Low</strong>: &lsquo;Low&rsquo; is set for a minimal image compression rate. Bitrate is reduced by approximately 15% from the original image; the data size is also reduced.</li>
                <li><strong class="UI">Medium</strong>: &lsquo;Medium&rsquo; is set for a medium image compression rate. Bitrate is reduced by approximately 30% from the original image; the data size is also reduced.</li>
                <li><strong class="UI">High</strong>: &lsquo;High&rsquo; is set for the maximum image compression rate. Bitrate is reduced by approximately 50% from the original image; the data size is also reduced.  </li>

             <li>To optimize the performance of the WiseStream, set <strong class="UI">[Dynamic GOV]</strong> and <strong class="UI">[Dynamic FPS]</strong> to <strong class="UI">[Enable]</strong> in the <strong class="UI">[Basic]</strong> > <strong class="UI">[Video Profile]</strong> menu. With <strong class="UI">[Dynamic GOV]</strong> and <strong class="UI">[Dynamic FPS]</strong> functions, you can achieve both the video quality and the number of frames per second. </li>
