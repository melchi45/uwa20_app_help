<h1 class="wn5-setup-main-title">WiseStream</h1>

<div class="wn5-setup-section">
    <p>WiseStream is a function that, by analyzing the complexity of an image, can effectively reduce the data size while still maintaining the quality. It reduces image size and saves on bandwidth by increasing the compression rate, if many motions are not created on the image being captured by the camera. If motion increases, the image returns to its previous status, preventing image information loss. This function is not suitable in an environment with much motion, as the screen may malfunction. When you complete the setting, click the <strong class="UI">[Apply]</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
