            <ul>
                <li>For enhanced security, it is recommended to create a password that combine special characters, numbers, and uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
                <li>It is recommended to change the password every three months.</li>
                <li>The password length and restrictions are as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For password of 8 to 9 digits, you need to combine at least three different types of the following: uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters.</li>
                    <li>For password of 10 to 15 digits, you need to combine at least two different types of the following: uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters.</li>
                    <li>It should be different from your ID.</li>
                    <li>You cannot use four consecutive letters of one type. (Ex: 1234, abcd)</li>
                    <li>You cannot repeat the same letter four or more times in a row. (Ex: !!!!, 1111, aaaa)</li>
                    <li>Only ~`!@#$%^*()_-+=|{}[].?/ are allowed for special characters.</li>
                    <li>After the factory reset, both the admin and user passwords will reset, and you need to create them again.</li>
                    <li>When you access the camera web viewer for the first time, or access it after the initialization, you will be moved to the password setting menu.</li>
                    <li>To use the web viewer menu, you need to set the new password in the password change menu and log in to the web viewer again with the changed password.</li>
                    <li>When changing the admin password, if the current password is not matched, then you cannot set the new password.</li>
                    <li>After changing the password, if there is a camera connected to a client, such as CMS or NVR, then you need to register the changed password before use. If you maintain the same connection, the client will use the previous password for authentication, so the account can be locked.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>When logging in to the web viewer, if you entered incorrect password more than five times, it will be locked for 30 seconds and you won’t be able to access the web viewer. </li>
                <li>If connection is made from various places with the same ID, or the password is changed while a number of Internet browsers are open, the Internet browsers may malfunction. It is recommended that a password be changed only from one location or only through one Internet browser.</li>
