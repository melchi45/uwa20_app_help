            <h4>Average&nbsp;number&nbsp;of&nbsp;people</h4>
            <p>The number of people counted in each queue rule from 00:00 to 24:00 is shown in a graph displayed by hour. </p>
            <p>When you select the name of a queue rule located at top right side of the graph, only the relevant graph will be shown in cyan. If you place the mouse on top of the graph, a balloon showing the number of people at the selected time will appear. </p>

            <p>The accumulated total queuing time is analyzed by the queue rules and the detection level (high, middle), and it is shown in the graph.</p>
            <p>The level of detection is specified in&nbsp;<strong class="UI"><a class="wn5-online-help-link" href="qmSetup.html#level" ng-href="#/help/queue_setup">[Level of detection]</a></strong> on the <strong class="UI">[Setup]</strong> page, and the level of queuing is classified into &apos;High&rsquo; and &lsquo;Medium&rsquo;, according to the number of people in the queue. </p>
            <p>For example, &apos;Queue 1- High&rsquo; indicates the total time during which there is a large number of queuing people in &apos;Queue 1&rsquo; as the &lsquo;High&rsquo; level of detection, and &lsquo;Queue 1- Medium&rsquo; indicates the total time during which there is a large number of queuing people in &apos;Queue 1&rsquo; as the &lsquo;Medium&rsquo; level of detection. </p>
