    <ul>
        <li>The people counting function aims at supplying statistical data but not data with real time accuracy, and it may include moving objects or animals in the total measured number of units.</li>
        <li>After installing the camera, it may continue to malfunction until it is stabilized. The time for stabilization may take up to 50 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>A camera to operate people counting requires that the lens to be installed on the ground in a direct drop. (Figure 1)</li>
        <li>In any of the following cases, errors in the measured data are likely to increase:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If installed in a space with no sufficient visions</li>
            <li>Night time or low brightness (Figure 2)</li>
            <li>In an environment with a sudden change in light, or in case of exposure to strong light, such as direct sunlight, sunset, sunrise, direct lighting, etc. (Figure 3)</li>
            <li>If there is consistent movement at the fixed location such as near the door (Figure 4)</li>
            <li>If many people move in a group</li>
            <li>If moving object is close to the set rule,</li>
            <li>If the rule is set at the outer edge of image for a fisheye camera (Figure 5)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In you set the object size to a value greater than the actual size in calibration, the measurement results can yield a less number of people than actual; on the contrary, if you set it to a smaller number, then it can yield a greater number of people than actual.</li>
